# film-exif mobile app
Mobile app to record info about pictures taken on film camera. 

This is simple excicise I took to learn some basics is ionic framework for mobile app development.

Idea of the app is to keep record of shutter speed and aperture for each picture taken on film camera. This is handy when learning photography on analog film camera.

This app is currently just prove of concept, so it is only working in a browser.

#Install

You will need node.js on your system. 

1. Run `npm install` in project folder
2. Run `ionic emulate browser` to see app working in web browser
